# DCC_Booster
Files for creating a High Power DCC++ Booster using Arduino UNO/Mega

These are all the files and documentation needed to create a DCC++ High Power Booster. The standard motor shield is only rated for 2amps, but in reality is capable of even less. This design uses a dual BTS7960B 43 amp H-Bridge to create a booster capable of much hugher track current. Although rated at 43amps, I DO NOT recommend pushing it that high.
Special thanks goes out to Dave Bodnar who originally designed the booster.  I am using his plans with a couple additions to create a stackable shield for the booster.
